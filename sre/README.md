# OSlash Serverless

This project was built using the [Serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/), Node.js & TypeScript.

## Installation/deployment instructions

Depending on your preferred package manager, follow the instructions below to deploy your project.

### Using NPM

- Run `npm i` to install the project dependencies
- Run `npx sls deploy` to deploy this stack to AWS

### Using Yarn

- Run `yarn` to install the project dependencies
- Run `yarn sls deploy` to deploy this stack to AWS

## Test your service

This project contains a single lambda function triggered by an HTTP request made on the provisioned API Gateway REST API `/hello` route with `POST` method. The request body must be provided as `application/json`. The body structure is tested by API Gateway against `src/functions/hello/schema.ts`.

- requesting any other path than `/hello` with any other method than `POST` will result in API Gateway returning a `403` HTTP error code
- sending a `POST` request to `/hello` with a payload **not** containing a string property named `name` will result in API Gateway returning a `400` HTTP error code
- sending a `POST` request to `/hello` with a payload containing a string property named `name` will result in API Gateway returning a `200` HTTP status code with a message saluting the provided name and the detailed event processed by the lambda

> :warning: As is, this project, once deployed, opens a **public** endpoint within your AWS account resources. Anybody with the URL can actively execute the API Gateway endpoint and the corresponding lambda. You should protect this endpoint with the authentication method of your choice.

### Locally

In order to test the hello function locally, run the following command:

- `npx sls invoke local -f hello --path src/functions/hello/mock.json` if you're using NPM
- `yarn sls invoke local -f hello --path src/functions/hello/mock.json` if you're using Yarn

Check the [`sls invoke local` command documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/invoke-local/) for more information.

### Remotely

Copy and replace your `url` - found in Serverless `deploy` command output - and `name` parameter in the following `curl` command in your terminal or in Postman to test your newly deployed application.

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://<my-api-endpoint>/dev/hello' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "OSlash"
}'
```
